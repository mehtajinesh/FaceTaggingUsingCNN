Face Detection and Tagging using Deep Learning

With the social media boom in today's world, we
see people constantly uploading photos of themselves along with
their friends and family on various social media platforms such
as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, etc. What if they want
to see all the photos in a categorized form such as photos with
a particular person. In this paper, we extend the concept of
Multiview Face Detection using Convolution Neural Networks
(CNN) used by Farfade et al. by providing a tagging system for
the detected faces. For the face detection, we use Deep Dense Face
Detector, which uses a single model based on deep convolutional
neural networks. All the detected faces are recognized using
Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) method. Precision,
recall, and F-measure are the parameters used to measure the
performance of the algorithm. An accuracy of 85% is achieved
for tagging the faces which are successfully detected.
